learning a foreign language was one of the most difficult yet most rewarding experience of my life. Although at times, learning a language was frustrating, it was well worth the effort.

my experience with a foreign language began in junior middle school, when i took my first english class, i had a king and paient teacher who often praised all of the students. Because of this positived method, i eagerly answerd all the questions i could, never worrying much about making mistakes, i was at the top of my class for two years.

when i went to senior school, i was eager to continue to study english, however, my experience in senior school was very different for before, whild my former teacher had been patient with all the students. my new teacher quickly punished those who gave incorrect answers. whenever we answerd incorrectly, she pointed a long stick at us and, shaking it up and down, shouted "No,No,No!" it didn't take me long time to lose my eagerness to answer questions. Not only did i lose my joy in answering questions, but also i totally lost my desire to say anything at all in english.

however, that state didn't stay last long. when i went to college, i learned that all students were required to take an English course. unlike my senior middle school teacher, my college english teacher were paient and kind, and none of them carried long, pointed sticks!however, the situation was far from perfect. as our class were very large, i was only able to answer a couple of questions in each class period. Also. after a few weeks of classes, i noticed there were many students who spoke much better than i did. i began to fell intimidated. so, once again, although for different reasons, i was afraid to speak. it seemed my english was going to stay at the same level forever.
